          <ul role="list">
            <li>GeoMiner’s total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms shall not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid to GeoMiner for the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the first incident giving rise to liability, and (b) CAD 10,000.</li>
            <li>GeoMiner shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, incidental, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, or business interruption, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>16. Indemnification</h3>
          <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless GeoMiner, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any loss, liability, claim, or demand arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Service; (b) Client Data; (c) your violation of these Terms; or (d) your violation of applicable laws or the rights of any third‑party.</p>

The place of arbitration shall be Vancouver, and the language shall be English.</p>

          <p>You represent that you are not located in, and will not use the Service from, any jurisdiction subject to Canadian, U.K., U.S., or E.U. embargoes, nor are you listed on any sanctions list. You will comply with all applicable export‑control and sanctions laws.</p>
